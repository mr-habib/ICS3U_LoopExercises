# ICS3U_LoopExercises

Your job will be to complete the following loop exercises. Each one will get a little bit tricker than the next, but I know you'll be able to do it!
Each exersice should be in the same file ```main.py``` and separated with some comments. For example:
```
...
# Natural Numbers Exercise -------
print("code does here")

# Mutiplication Table Exercise ----
print("Code goes here")

...
```
## Natural Numbers
Have the user input a positive integer. Print all the numbers from 0 up to (AND INCLUDING) the user's inputted number.
Example interaction:
```
>> Enter a number: 3
0
1
2
3
```

## Multiplication table
Have the user input an integer (Could be positive or negative). Print the first twelve multiles of the user's number.</br>
Example interaction:
```
>> Enter a number: 2
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
22
24
```

## Only one remainder
Have the user input a positive integer. Print all the numbers less than the user's number that have a remainder of 1 when dividing by 3. Hint: Remember that modulous operator? It gives you back the remainder after division. For example ```7 % 3``` is 1 because 3 goes into 7 two times with a remainder of 1. </br>
Example Interaction:
```
>> Enter a number: 10
1
4
7
```
Notice I didn't print 10!!

## Awesome Triangles
Have the user input a positive integer. Print out a triangle pattern based off of their input.</br>
Example Interaction:
```
>> Enter a number: 3
1
1 2
1 2 3
```
```
>> Enter a number: 5
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Factorial
Have the user input a positive integer greater than 0. Print out the factorial of the number.
A factorial is the product of all of the positive integers before it. To see what that even means, let's look at an example:</br>
5 factorial (denoted 5!) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1</br>
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1</br>
10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 *  * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1</br>
Hopefully that makes sense.</br>
Example Interaction:
```
>> Enter a number: 5
120
```
Note that 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
